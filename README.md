Usage:
  At first, it is just a very database program with graphical user-interface, helping to learn new words in English;
  
  I really love reading books, and since English is my second language and I learn new words everyday, it is so difficult to keep track of what words I learned today. This program is here to help; it will remind you of the new words that you want to learn while using your computer, and wants you to make an example. Later on, after 5 practices, you can have yourself taken exam to see what words you forgot and review the words.
